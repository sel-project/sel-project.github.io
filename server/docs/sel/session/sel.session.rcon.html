        <h1>sel.session.rcon</h1>
RCON allows the execution of commands remotely and it's available
 in the official Minecraft server since 1.9. It's an implementation
 of the 
 by Valve.
<br><br>
The protocol is only implemented in SEL to mantain compatibility with
 other server softwares and managers that uses it.
 A better alternative offered by SEL is the external console protocol,
 which is an advanced version of RCON and also accessible through browser
 using websockets.<br><br>

<dl><dt><big><a name="RconHandler"></a>class <u>RconHandler</u>: <u>sel.network.handler.HandlerThread</u>;
</big></dt>
<dd>The handler thread only accepts connections on a blocking
 TCP socket and starts new sessions in another thread, if
 the address of the client is not blocked by the server.<br><br>

</dd>
<dt><big><a name="RconSession"></a>class <u>RconSession</u>: <u>sel.network.session.Session</u>;
</big></dt>
<dd>An Rcon session runs in a dedicated thread and only waits
 for data on a blocking socket after the login.
<br><br>
The first login packet must arrive within 1 second since
 the creation of the session and it must be a login packet
 with the password in it.
 If the packet doesn't arrive, its format is wrong or the
 password is wrong the session is closed.
<br><br>

 Once successfully connected the socket's receive timeout
 is set to infinite and the session only waits for remote
 commands.
<br><br>

 The session never times out and it's only closed when the
 remote socket has been closed or a packet with the wrong
 format is received.<br><br>

<dl><dt><big><a name="RconSession.loop"></a>protected shared void <u>loop</u>();
</big></dt>
<dd>Waits for a command packet and let the server parses
 it if it is longer than 0 bytes.<br><br>
